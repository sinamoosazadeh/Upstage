# SESSION V3c — Independent Verification (L-001…L-015: quality, math and numerical layer)

**Baseline:** `85b2c155d7b054a468379ddfd802eb239d0801f9` (verified with `git rev-parse HEAD`;
`git log -1 --oneline` = `85b2c15 Merge pull request #25 from sinamoosazadeh/arena/01a0d98b-upstage`).
All source line numbers are against this commit.

**Inputs:** full audit report `AUDIT/APEX_GEN5_AUDIT.md` @ `690e2d8899319a7c7a96456f92c3008878e59346`
(fetched to `/tmp/AUDIT.md`), index `AUDIT/APEX_GEN5_AUDIT_INDEX.md` @ same commit (`/tmp/INDEX.md`).
Session V3 (`AUDIT/VERIFY_V3.md` @ `arena/01a0e8ac-upstage`) verified K-001…K-012 and session V3b
(`AUDIT/VERIFY_V3b.md` @ `arena/01a0e9b1-upstage`) verified X-V3b-001 (= ISSUE-079, measured) plus
K-013…K-026; both were read first for method (real repository code, temporary/in-memory SQLite
with the repository's own DDL, explicit synthetic-vs-device boundary) and are cited, not redone.

**Read-only discipline:** no repository source, config, test or document file was modified;
no pull request, no `main`, no order, no exchange/Telegram endpoint, no secret, no `.env`,
no `data/`. The only files added are under `AUDIT/`. Probe databases are written to `/tmp`.

**Environment:** `python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages -q -r requirements.lock pytest`
(numpy 1.26.0, pytest 9.1.1), tests run as `python3 -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider <path>`.

**Synthetic boundary (applies to every row):** every reproduction below uses synthetic data
and, where a store is needed, a synthetic SQLite database built with the repository's own DDL
and its own write methods. Synthetic success is never proof about the owner's device database,
and synthetic failure proves the code path, not that it has already damaged a device record.
